## What is Koolio.io?

In essence, a website of Flippable Cards. Koolio.io is a place where you can **share** and **view** two-sided flippable cards. For **Fun** or other purposes. To know more, see [About Koolio.io](http://koolio.io/about)

Koolio.io is a nice place to share things in a unique and creative way, and to seek inspiration by exploring other people's creativity. You also have the option to create private decks where you can keep your personal notes. Also, you can share your decks to your friends so that they can edit them too.

Watch [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/miestg4TnQE) about user interactions with cards.

#### Embed a Card

One of the cool features of koolio is that it allows **embedding a Koolio card onto another website**.
For example, I embedded these two cards about making dumplings on my website. And they can be flipped there too!

## More
Koolio.io is **open source**. Welcome pull requests. Welcome development efforts.

I had this idea in my sophomore-junior year and started developing back
then. Currently my interests have shifted, so **my development of Koolio.io has
been suspended. But community contribution is always welcomed!** I hope someone
gets excited about this and wants to start maintaining this project or even run
this as a business!
