# Koolio

Brutal. Trending. Unexpected.

Koolio is a social network website that uses flashcard as the medium for information. Users create and interact with contents via flashcards, which are flippable, i.e. two-sided, and can be grouped by decks. The types of content on both side of the cards are diverse, including text, video, pictures, and even things like calendar or calendar event, location on a map, and more. When other users view your cards, they can click and flip them to know what's on the other side. Koolio offers a more creative, interactive, fun and organized way to share & display the information (the content).
