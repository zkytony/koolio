# Koolio

Koolio is a website where users can create and share flippable two-sided cards, grouped by decks; users get to choose what to put on each side of the cards. Explore other people's creativity, and ignite yours! 

Kooiio is much more flexible than just exploiting your creativity. It can be used for many things; one example could be note keeping.
